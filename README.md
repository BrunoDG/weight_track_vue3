# Weight Tracker in Vue 3

This is a simple weight tracker simply created with Vue 3 and CSS, for learning purposes only. Probably, I'll upgrade this one or remake it using the same tech, but with Typescript and integration with Supabase or Google Docs.

## Recommended IDE Setup

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur) + [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin).
